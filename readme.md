**TicTacToe Battle** is a modern, responsive, and interactive single-player TicTacToe game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This game offers a clean UI and allows users to choose their player (X or O) before starting the match. The computer then competes using intelligent random moves.
